The Company will distribute an amount of USD 3,149,951.60 by way of a stock dividend at a ratio of 2 new shares for every 125 shares held by shareholders. Mr Sugiman Layanto, Managing Director of PT Wintermar Offshore Marine said, "The use of a stock dividend this year is to maintain our policy to distribute up to 20% of the earnings each year to shareholders but to conserve cash which we believe can be profitably invested in new vessels to serve the increasing demands in offshore oil exploration." The Company also announced a cash dividend of Rp2.16 per share which will be applied where necessary to meet the withholding tax liabilities of shareholders. The shareholders at the Meeting also approved the plan of the Company to re-purchase up to 190 million shares or about 5.2% of the issued shares, at any time over the next 18 months. Mr Sugiman Layanto explained that this plan was to enable the Company to acquire Treasury stock if it was felt that the shares were undervalued at any time in the market. "Obviously we will not repurchase our shares unless there is a clear benefit to all shareholders," said Mr Sugiman Layanto. For 2012, the Company's net profit grew by 23% from the previous year to USD 20.2 million and EBITDA increased 27% in the year to USD 40.4 million. The Company has also revised its 2013 capex plan to 8-10 vessels making total full year capex about USD 65-70 million to achieve profit growth of 20-25%. As at May 2013, WINS has contracts on hand totalling USD 200 million.
