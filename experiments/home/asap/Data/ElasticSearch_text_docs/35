It looks like the new Mac Pro is now available to ship in February. Did Apple launch the product with low supplies, or has interest in the powerful computer rather been unprecedented? Original article. The Apple Online Store is back, and as expected, Apple’s Mac Pro is now available to purchase. The high-end Mac computer starts at $2,999.00 and is shipping from Dec. 30, 2013, according to the online store. Apple is offering two iterations of the Mac Pro – one for $2,999.00 and another for $3,999.00 – and customers can also customize the computer with upgraded hardware, too. CPU, graphics, RAM, and flash storage can all be upgraded for a price, and Apple is also offering its Thunderbolt Display and a Sharp-made 4K display (for $3,595) in the Apple Online Store. For a fully-loaded Mac Pro, customers can expect to pay $9,599 in the U.S. Apple Online Store. Throw in Sharp’s 4K display, and you’re looking at one powerful – yet costly – machine. Upgraded Mac Pros are presently carrying an unspecified “January” delivery estimate, however. Apple explains online: The Mac Pro is available with a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.9 GHz, dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs with 2GB of VRAM each, 12GB of memory, and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage starting at $2,999 (US); and with a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.9 GHz, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs with 3GB of VRAM each, 16GB of memory, and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage starting at $3,999 (US). Configure-to-order options include faster 8-core or 12-core Intel Xeon E5 processors, AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of VRAM, up to 64GB of memory, and up to 1TB of PCIe-based flash storage. Additional technical specifications, configure-to-order options and accessories are available online at www.apple.com/mac-pro. Plus, the new Mac Pro carries an “Assembled in the USA” tag, too.
