(Katherine Frey/TWP) Nationals pitching coach Steve McCatty will be released from a Washington hospital today after he stayed three nights to treat an irregular heartbeat, Manager Davey Johnson said. The Nationals plan on McCatty rejoining the team on Monday after they finish their five-game road trip. The Nationals will likely add either Syracuse pitching coach Greg Booker or pitching coordinator Spin Williams to their staff for three games in Milwaukee, Johnson said. Last night, Johnson himself performed the duties of the pitching coach. McCatty, 59, first experienced an irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure Sunday morning. He left Nationals Park and was hospitalized before the Nationals played the Mets.
