Megan McArdle Aug 28 2007, 10:29 AM ET Tweet More Email Print One doesn't know quite what to say about the Craig revelations except to wonder about the statistics. If two Republican legislators get caught in a relatively short period of time . . . well, I know it's just a coincidence, but still. How commonly does this sort of thing happen in the general population? And if it doesn't happen commonly, why is it happening so often in our legislative bodies? Presumably they didn't run for office in order to enjoy broader opportunities to solicit undercover cops. Meanwhile, perhaps it is just that I am a woman, but I am a little puzzled by this: Radley Balko remarks "Guess there's some sort moral distinction between cheating on your wife via anonymous gay sex and cheating on your wife by paying for hetero sex with a prostitute." I can imagine distinguishing between these cases, but I would think that any difference would tend to cut in favor of Craig rather than against him, since paying prostitutes for sex is a real crime and it's still unclear to me what it is Craig's guilty of -- he mostly seems to have been brought up on charges of "being gay in the Midwest." Either way, Hewitt seems to be drawing the distinction based on pure homophobia. Legally, I agree that the cops have no business worrying about Craig's sex life, or for that matter, the sex lives of men who seek to employ prostitutes of whatever persuasion. But if I were Craig's wife, I'd be far more worried about my husband trolling random bathrooms for anonymous men, than by his sleeping with prostitutes. Given the relative risks of male-to-male and female-to-male HIV transmission, I'd be crazy not to worry more. Should that matter to the public, if not the police?
