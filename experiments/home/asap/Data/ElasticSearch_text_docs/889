Sign in Published on Sep 19, 2013 Modesto Junior College in California told a student that he could not pass out copies of the United States Constitution outside the student center on September 17, 2013—Constitution Day. Captured on video, college police and administrators demanded that Robert Van Tuinen stop passing out Constitution pamphlets and told him that he would only be allowed to pass them out in the college's tiny free speech zone, and only after scheduling it several days or weeks ahead of time. This video contains the relevant portions of Van Tuinen's experience. The three full, unedited videos taken by the students can be watched below: Video 1: http://youtu.be/8Jvkm0kuTMI Video 2: http://youtu.be/T-uvjBEYQbE Video 3: http://youtu.be/gi9AXgIUXpA Category Nonprofits & Activism License Standard YouTube License Show more Show less Loading...
