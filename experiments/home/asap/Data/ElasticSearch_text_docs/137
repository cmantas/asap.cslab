Now, the brave mariner, who survived a 2009 standoff with Somali pirates, is “Captain Phillips,” thanks to the Tom Hanks movie of the same name — with enough starpower that reporters packed a room Thursday to hear him hold forth on sequester cuts. “We are the truckdrivers of the ocean,” he said of his seafaring brethren before teeing off on his celebvocacy talking points: As many as four U.S. Merchant Marine vessels that haul military cargo or food to needy foreign lands could be drydocked with the loss of $12 million in subsidies. But he fielded a lot of pirate questions. “It’s the second oldest profession we deal with,” he said dryly. “They’re not dumb, they are imaginative, and they are capable.” Should he have heeded advisories to steer clear of Somalia? Heck, those are just advisories. “We fight [piracy] all over the globe. Nigeria’s probably worse these days than Somalia ever was.” Enjoy the movie? “I think Tom Hanks did a great job. Looking at his eyes. . . you could feel the fear.” Related:  Captain Phillips reviewed by Ann Hornaday More Reliable Source: Duck Dynasty; Joe Scarborough; Julian Assange; Marilyn Monroe; Michelle Obama; Jonas Brothers; Hayden Panettiere © The Washington Post Company
