(Grant W. Martin Photography) Whoâ€™d have guessed that Andre Agassi is a champion at the sport of the after-dinner speech, too? The tennis legend unexpectedly lit up the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of Americaâ€™s annual dinner Tuesday night during the late-hour awards segment when so many galas find themselves bogged down in earnestness. Taking the stage at the downtown Ritz-Carlton after a performance by Eastern High Schoolâ€™s youth choir, Agassi praised the young singers. â€œKind of makes me want to fly home and slap my kids,â€� he deadpanned. â€œWhat have they done with their lives?â€� As the surprised laughter caught up with him, he coyly moved on: â€œSorry, not on script here.â€� Twinkly-eyed and dapper in a dark suit, Agassi deftly toed the line between sincere and sassy. Citing his own experience running an education foundation, he commended the hosts for â€œhow targeted and focused and involved you are in these communities.â€� So often, he said, foundations are â€œtempted to go entirely horizontal.â€‰.â€‰. and you lose the depth and connection.â€� CADCA hasnâ€™t, he said: â€œWell done on pulling that [expletive] off!â€� He drew another big laugh teasing the dinnerâ€™s equally sassy emcee, former Rep. Mary Bono, who had recalled meeting him at a charity match in Vegas years ago. â€œMary, I remember you from that game,â€� he said. â€œI was shocked by how much you were staring at Stefan Edbergâ€™s ass.â€� More Reliable Source: George H.W.
