 print Obama on HealthCare.gov: ‘I wanted to go in and fix it myself, but I don’t write code’ By Aaron Blake, Updated: November 8, 2013 at 4:08 pm President Obama said Friday that he was so frustrated by the problems with HealthCare.gov that he would have tried to fix it himself -- if he could. "I wanted to go in and fix it myself, but I don’t write code," Obama said during a speech in New Orleans. Obama also joked that one day that health-care law would start succeeding, and people would no longer call it "Obamacare." "I know health care is controversial, so there’s only so much bipartisan support we’re going to get,” Obama said, adding -- “until it starts working really well, and they stop calling it 'Obamacare.'" A poll released Friday by the Pew Research Center showed 59 percent of Americans disapprove of Obama's handling of health care, and 53 percent disapprove of him overall, compared to 41 percent who approve -- a new low.
