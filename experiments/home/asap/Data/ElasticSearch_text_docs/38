The paper was written by Research in Action, a small independent research and consulting organization based in Germany. Since nobody at AppDynamics had heard of this analyst before and we were not contacted to provide any input, we decided to take a closer look at in the content of the research paper.  Below are our findings. Evaluation Criteria: Vendors were evaluated based on two dimensions, each of which was broken into 5 criteria. A few of the results jump out as being a little unusual: 1) Customer satisfaction Here at AppDynamics we are fanatical about customer satisfaction. In fact, we just recently announced that our Net Promoter Score (NPS) has increased yet again over the course of the past year from 81 to 84. None of the other vendors considered in this research paper publicise their own NPS, presumably because they are not as fanatical about customer support or as proud of their score as we are. The only public reference we could find is a research paper which lists CA as having an NPS of 18 and Compuware as having an NPS of just 3! We are therefore somewhat perplexed to see that Research in Action scored us much lower in this category than both CA and Compuware.  This is particularly true as we regularly encounter organisations such as Karavel and Edmunds who have openly described how they performed their own detailed evaluations of these vendors and ultimately decided to use AppDynamics. FACT: AppDynamics has a Net Promoter Score of 84 which is the highest published NPS of all vendors evaluated. 2) Product strategy and roadmap: We often discuss parts of our product roadmap and future corporate direction with analysts and valued customers, but as a software vendor in a competitive market we do not make this information public for obvious reasons. How then was Research in Action able to accurately evaluate AppDynamics (or indeed any of the vendors) on these criteria without contacting us to provide input? FACT: AppDynamics has never been briefed on the contents of Research in Action’s report or been asked to verify any facts reported by Research in Action regarding our product roadmap or strategy. 3) Architecture and scalability Without being contacted to provide any information we are unsure where the detail in the report regarding our architecture and scalability came from.  However, we suspect that the information Research in Action does have may not be very accurate. At AppDynamics, we openly discuss our architecture and scalability.  For example, a recent blog by our very own Dustin Whittle describes how we scaled our End User Monitoring cloud for billions of transactions. In fact, AppDynamics monitors some of the largest documented applications in the world and has customers monitoring many millions of transactions per day. Some of our larger customers have well over 10,000 JVM nodes all being monitored with AppDynamics. This is something we are confident other APM vendors with equal or higher scoring are not able to claim, which leaves us a little confused by the scoring in this category. FACT: We have no record of anyone from Research in Action, including the papers author, who has legitimately downloaded a self-service trial from the AppDynamics website in order to evaluate the architecture and scalability of our technology Sources: The paper states: “The information contained in this research has been obtained from both enterprise as well as vendor sources believed to be reliable”. Yet the 21 sources of information cited in the footnotes of the paper are less than credible.  These sources are as follows: 9 Wikipedia articles 7 vendor press releases/company websites 2 blog posts 2 press articles 1 survey conducted by Research in Action With respect to the survey noted above, Research in Action does not provide information regarding which or how many people were surveyed, or the nature of the questions included in the survey. However a quick look on Compuware’s public SlideShare account reveals a slide-deck highlighting data from the survey which Research in Action apparently presented earlier this year at a Compuware event back in July. FACT: None of AppDynamics’ customers have informed us they took a query from Research in Action, and AppDynamics was not asked to verify any information published within this report. This is most bizarre given all leading analysts perform a factual review of their research with each vendor prior to publishing to ensure the information contained is accurate. Misleading: The visual format of the “Vendor Selection Matrix” looks remarkably like a clone of the well-respected Gartner Magic Quadrant. Other analysts have found alternative and innovative methods to depict this information, such as the Forrester Wave, or the IDC MarketScape; helping to differentiate the different analyst opinions. Unfortunately this particular report strikes such a close resemblance to the Gartner MQ that it could easily be mistaken for the other report at first glance. The paper is described as an evaluation of the Top 10 players in the ”Deep Application Transaction Management” space. The term “Deep Application Transaction Management” is not used widely within the APM market, in fact as far as we are aware it is used exclusively by Compuware, and up until very recently was even part of their official product name “dynaTrace Deep Application Transaction Management”. It does seem Research in Action is particularly familiar with Compuware since they have paid-for content listed on their website. Perhaps this also explains why Compuware seems to be the only vendor that is actively publicising this paper despite multiple vendors, including AppDynamics, being labeled as “Market Leaders”. In fact when the paper was released, Compuware was quick to spread word of it triumphantly over numerous media and social-media outlets. AppDynamics was never even notified of its publication or provided with a copy. Given Compuware’s position in last year’s Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM, we find it very unusual for them to be making so much noise about Research in Action. Gartner is certainly a more widely recognised, trusted, and credible source which a very large number of organisations already pay attention to. So why draw so much focus towards this publication from a relatively unknown analyst? Summary For those unfamiliar with the world of analysts, there is an interesting blogpost by Aneel Lakhani, a former Gartner research director, which describes the various types of analysts and the content they produce.   “Many analyst firms are pay-for-play. Many will write whitepapers and ‘advertorials’ that are underwritten by vendors. I find these (after too much experience) highly suspect and particularly worthless.” With this and the issues noted above in mind, we invite those currently looking at the APM  to instead to try AppDynamics for free and perform an evaluation for yourself.  After all, there is no substitute for your own experience and no better judge than yourself. If you want a credible independent view of the APM market then reach out to the analysts you subscribe to, most of who, spend hours each day with clients to advise on them on the deployment of APM within their organisation.

Post by Dustin Whittle | Dec, 10, 2013 | In APM Best Practice, APM Thought Leadership, PHP 0 Comments PHP 5.2 was released in 2006. If you are still running PHP 5.2, it is time to join 2013 and upgrade to at least PHP 5.4 if not to the currently stable PHP 5.5.6. There are many reasons to upgrade your PHP stack to the latest and greatest — not only does every release include new features and stability improvements, but more importantly, they also have security fixes. Security is essential for the trust of your users. If you are continuing to run PHP 5.2 you are throwing your users’ trust away. There were over 100 vulnerabilities in the first four releases in PHP 5.2.x. It is outdated, expired, past due and no longer suitable for production applications. Strong words, eh? Just take a look at the list of known vulnerabilities since PHP 5.2: OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities PHP Security Checklist PHP Security Notes Do the right thing and make some progress on your technical debt. Your users will thank you.

If you aren’t running PHP 5.4 or newer you really should take the time to update. Not only are there critical security fixes, but you will see better performance immediately! Take it a step further and harden PHP and check your project for known vulnerabilities Hardened PHP Project + Suhosin SensioLabs Insight Symfony Security Checker “PHP, like any other large system, is under constant scrutiny and improvement. Each new version will often include both major and minor changes to enhance security and repair any flaws, configuration mishaps, and other issues that will affect the overall security and stability of your system. Like other system-level scripting languages and programs, the best approach is to update often, and maintain awareness of the latest versions and their changes.” Take five minutes to get complete visibility into the performance of your production applications with AppDynamics Pro today.
