Lee: 'It's refreshing' Obama has acknowledged ObamaCare problems Published November 07, 2013 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 LinkedIn 0   ADVERTISEMENT GOP Sen. Mike Lee told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum Thursday night that it is “refreshing” to hear President Obama apologize over Americans losing their coverage under his health care law, saying he is interested to see what the president’s next step will be. “I think it’s refreshing that the president is acknowledging this is a problem, that he’s acknowledging that he made promises that people relied on to their detriment because those promises were based on inaccurate information, he wasn’t telling us the truth,” Lee, R-Utah, said on “On the Record.” Lee said he also thought it was refreshing to hear Obama promise to fix the problem. “I look forward to seeing action by the president to make sure that these people who have been harmed as a result of his actions and his incorrect words – I want to know what he’s going to do,” Lee said.
