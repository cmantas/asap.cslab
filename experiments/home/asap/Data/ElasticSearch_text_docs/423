Timberlake's free single includes four songs performed live at the 2013 iTunes Festival in London and is being offered as part of Apple's holiday giveaway promotion, which is only accessible via the 12 Days of Gifts app found in select iOS App Stores. The "12 Days" digital content giveaway has become somewhat of a tradition for many iTunes users, though the app was previously limited to Canada and a few major European countries. For 2013, Apple has extended the promo to U.S. customers for the first time, granting them access to freebies that in the past have included movies, music, e-books, apps and more. Earlier in December, Apple gave away Lorde's latest single "No Better" as a preview for the 12 Days of Gifts app, labeling it as a "gift to get you started." Apple's "12 Days of Gifts" program runs from Dec. 26 through Jan. 6, with each day bringing a free download that will be available for 24 hours. Some content may not be available in all areas. 12 Days of Gifts is a free 64.7MB download from the App Store.

Didn't download the full songs. tdknox 12/26/2013 02:04 AM Wow, really? You must be a lot of fun at parties. saarek 12/26/2013 02:20 AM This was free upon release, so thanks for the already free gift Apple. solipsismx 12/26/2013 02:48 AM Quote: Originally Posted by saarek  This was free upon release, so thanks for the already free gift Apple. What's wrong with '12 Days of Regifts'? coolfactor 12/26/2013 03:08 AM Don't get greedy now. Free is free. Although if this was indeed free beforehand then it's kinda low since then Apple is using the term "gift" in a purely self-promotion, self-marketing fashion, and that would be a low-blow to loyal customers. apple ][ 12/26/2013 04:00 AM You couldn't pay me 99 cents to download these tracks.   I guess that 13 year old girls with not yet fully developed breasts are probably happy about this free download.   Hopefully something better and more useful will show up in the remaining days of this giveaway. vaporland 12/26/2013 04:46 AM Hoping to download a new Mac Pro... michael scrip 12/26/2013 05:51 AM Only 11 more days of people bitching about free downloads...
