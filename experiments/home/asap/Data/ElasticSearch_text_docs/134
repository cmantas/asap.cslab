 print Obama’s birthday dinner at Rasika By The Reliable Source, Updated: August 9, 2013 at 5:19 pm A belated birthday dinner for President Obama: he and the first lady dined at Rasika West End Thursday night. The Indian restaurant is a favorite; Michelle Obama visited two months ago. The dinner — in a private room on the lower level — was a surprise until the couple (POTUS in a suit, the first lady in a backless black dress) arrived at the restaurant, when a crowd formed outside.  Obama celebrated his actual birthday (52, for those keeping track) Sunday at Camp David.
