The news was grim for BlackBerry in the company's first financial report since an executive reshuffling that saw then-CEO Thorsten Heins forced out and replaced by former Sybase chief John S. Chen, with revenues down 24 percent from the previous quarter and 56 percent from the same time one year ago. The $4.4 billion loss was helped along by $4.6 billion in one-time charges related to the restructuring and inventory commitments. BlackBerry now has just $3.2 billion in the bank --?less than half as much as rival Apple puts away in a single quarter. Alongside the drop in revenue came a precipitous decline in device sales, with the company moving over 1.5 million fewer smartphones than they did in the previous quarter. BlackBerry 10-series devices continue to face tepid demand, representing less than one-fourth of the Waterloo, Ontario-based company's sales. The lone bright spot in BlackBerry's third quarter results was the revelation that more than 40 million users have signed up for BlackBerry Messenger since its launch, as BlackBerry has convinced more than a dozen manufacturers to preinstall the app on their Android devices. BlackBerry Messenger's cross-platform rollout was originally conceived by company cofounder Jim Balsillie, but the strategy was later spiked by Heins and only resurrected after the abject failure of BlackBerry 10, which eventually cost Heins his job. As part of a new emerging market strategy, BlackBerry also announced that it has inked an agreement with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn to "jointly develop and manufacture certain new BlackBerry devices and manage the inventory associated with those devices." The company says the partnership's first product will be a smartphone for the Indonesian market, where BlackBerry still enjoys a strong presence.

I read in one place that they sold 4.4 million devices, but that must be wrong. Last quarter they sold about 3.6 million devices, and this quarter, sales are well down from that. Elsewhere, I read that they sold 1.6 million devices. Their sales dropped from $1.6 billion two quarters ago to $1.2 billion last quarter. In addition, their cash position is confusing. I haven't yet read their financials, and won't have time to do so during the day today, but cash and equivalents rising from $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion is counterintuitive to a company in the situation Blackberry finds itself. So for the moment, I'm assuming that this is because they are now counting the $1 billion in bonds they issued that Fairfax bought up in the total. That would make more sense, as the carryover from the quarter before would then actually be $2.2 billion. That makes more sense. Their cash situation therefor is actually continuing to deteriorate.

The carnage this company has caused in the markets they have disrupted is simply unacceptable. First it was the mp3 player market riddled with the dead bodies of formerly big players like Creative and finally the Microsoft Zune. Next came the smartphone market which is now filled with the stench of wasted away companies like Blackberry, Moto, HTC, Nokia. Then came the iPad and the carnage it has heaped upon the PC business. Are we going to stand by and watch this, this Apple thingy do the same to the television and wearable tech markets? It’s time to take a stand! No more disruptions!

Why are they losing so much money? Respectfully, your perspective needs an adjustment.  That's 4.3 million devices in a quarter (phones of all types).  Apple is manufacturing/selling the iPhone 5s's (just the one model) at a rate of a half million PER DAY.  http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/27/foxconn-building-500k-iphone-5s-units-for-apple-per-day-with-nonstop-production-lines   As to why BB is losing money, I can only suggest that their customers won't pay enough to cover costs and provide a profit (i.e., the product is not compelling enough that people will pay a premium for it). And BB doesn't have an effective, money-making app store.  Perhaps BB users buy a phone, and are satisfied doing their email and gabbing.  Whereas iPhone customers actually BUY apps and USE their phones for many more daily activities, ranging from internet-browsing to gaming to reading to productivity, to health monitor/workout coach and much more!

NO ONE sells as many of one model as Apple. How are they doing against Nokia, Samsung, HTC, Huwuai (or however it's spelled).  Samsung is profiting and most of the others are lucky to break even but none seem to be bleeding as badly as Blackberry. But to answer your original question it's not a matter of how many units you can push (even though economics of scale do play a part) it's about what your costs are compared to your revenue. Their new devices running BB10 only accounted for 25% of their device sales which means 75% are all old models that simply aren't profitable like they used to be. Who knows if any of their BB devices are sold at a profit. For all we know they are selling them at a loss specifically to look healthier to investors in that regard and hopping to bouy their profits with their backend services. Regardless, their costs are far exceeding their revenue, which isn't helped by all these executive changeover which usually come with huge golden parachutes. Can they figure out how to carve out a niche before it's too late? It's possible, but I think it's unlikely.

Cash flow and profits/losses are not the same thing.  As someone else pointed out a few messages before yours if you don't count the write-downs they would have made $200 million last quarter.  Obviously big losses are bad news, but you can't just project those losses forward and  compare to money in the bank.  Most (all?) of there reported losses are paper losses accounting for capital expenditure that were made in the past.
