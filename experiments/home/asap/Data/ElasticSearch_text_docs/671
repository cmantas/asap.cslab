Recession Strikes -- Men Hit Hardest? - Ideas Special Report
 The Atlantic Home « The Problem of Penalties | Main | Cut Out the Rating Agencies » 29 June 2009 4:12 PM Business / Economics Recession Strikes -- Men Hit Hardest? by Conor Friedersdorf The Week in Review: Writing in Foreign Policy, Reihan Salam joins those anointing this downturn a great "he-cession" (more links below) -- in which "the great shift of power from males to females is likely to be dramatically accelerated" across Europe and the United States. Citing heavily disproportionate job losses among men, Salam notes that, by inflating a housing bubble and attendant blue-collar industries like construction, Wall Street's macho risk-taking may simply have masked longer-term declines in male economic power brought on by globalization. Now, he writes, the world must figure how to handle a different macho problem: masses of "surly, lonely and hard-drinking men" without jobs, wives or much education, and more prone to mental illness.
