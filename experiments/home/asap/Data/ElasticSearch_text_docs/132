Kerry’s voice faltered a bit and he paused a couple of times to find the words:Â  “I want to thank everyone for the remarkable outpouring of good wishes. It’s been really, uh, very special. We are very, very humbled by the expressions of support. I think she’s coming along, and I know when she’s able to she’ll thank everybody herself.” Teresa Heinz Kerry, 74, entered a hospital Sunday after falling ill with seizure-like symptoms. Doctors have told the family they have ruled out causes such as a brain tumor, stroke or heart attack, a Kerry rep said Tuesday. Kerry is expected to return to his wife’s bedside in Boston today.
