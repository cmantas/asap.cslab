Luck admits he spent his younger years trying to emulate the things guys like Brady did on the field. Now he's trying to beat Brady at his own game and on his home turf Saturday night in a divisional-round game. Luck has spent the last two seasons rewriting the record books. He's thrown for more yards in his first two NFL seasons than anyone in history. He's won 22 regular season games, second only to Russell Wilson since 1970. And last week, he pulled off the second-greatest playoff comeback ever. What can he and the Colts (12-5) do for an encore ? Try to eliminate the Pats (12-4).
