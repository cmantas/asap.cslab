First launched in the App Store since 2008 with a $4.99 price tag, the "Texas Hold'em" game developed by Apple is no longer available. Its removal was first noticed on Thursday by MacRumors. Though "Texas Hold'em" was the only game Apple released for the iPhone, it was not the first title the company released for its portable devices. In fact, the poker game was first launched in 2006 for the iPod classic, and utilized the device's click wheel. Apple stopped selling its iPod click wheel games earlier this year, in a similar move where the content was quietly removed from the iTunes Store. Over the years there were signs that Apple was interested in creating more original games for the iOS App Store. In 2009, AppleInsider discovered that the company was looking to hire a first-class game developer to work at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. And in August of 2010, one rumor claimed that Apple was close to acquiring a Chinese mobile Internet service provider and game developer for $148 million. However, there was never any actual indication that Apple purchased, or even considered buying, Handseeing Information Technology Co. Instead of developing its own games, Apple has chosen to concentrate on its iOS ecosystem and the App Store where third-party developers can make their own blockbuster titles, like "Angry Birds," "Plants vs. Zombies," and "Flight Control." Apple has supported its developers with Game Center, a social networking service that lets users track their friends' progress in titles and even play games against each other head-to-head online.

As opposed to those other games, poker has always been about money, that's the whole point. Bluffing means nothing when people have nothing to lose. When money is on the line, people are put to the test. Winning a fake poker game means nothing, winning real money in poker means something.

They could kitty, but Apple's culture is to take out the trash once in a while. Anything that is not a part of their current strategy is shown the door.

Apple doesn't care about that. There are a ton of other poker apps available on the iOS store and also plenty of bloody, violent and gory games also available. I also disagree that poker is gambling, that's what the people in the govt claim to try and get it banned. Poker is a game of skill, with a certain amount of luck included. It's far from all luck. A skilled player will decimate non-skilled players. I paid for my iPad 2 using mostly poker winnings.

That time has obviously passed, it achieved its objective, and they probably just don't feel like supporting or updating it anymore. Sad to see it go and lose support, it's a decent poker app. Reply Reply post # 23 of 27 11/17/11 at 4:11pm asdasd Joined: Jun 2003 Posts: 2,469 offline Select All Posts By This User I don't know why they got rid - but it was and is a pretty awesome app. I wanted dsadsa bit it was taken.
