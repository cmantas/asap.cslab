Via Facebook, the business invited its loyal customer base to “have that last shot” last night (Sunday). “Due to recent events, Amy and I have been forced to do a little soul searching & have made the heart breaking decision to close Lucy’s Arl Shirlington,” the Facebook page said. “We appreciate all of the love and support y’all have given these last couple of crazy years and will be here til the wee hours to have that last shot and make a few more memories. Brave the cold and get your assets to Lucy’s! Deep discounts and indoor smoking!” Lucy’s opened in the summer of 2011 at 2620 S. Shirlington Road, replacing the former Champion Billiards. It was run by Misti Wise and Amy Borek, former Champion bartenders who gave Lucy’s a unique personality of its own. Their tagline for the pool hall: “Shrews. Brews. Cues.” It’s unclear which events led to the closure. Wise and Borek could not be immediately reached for comment.
