Democrats to pull racy posters from campuses By Ben Pershing October 22, 2013 at 3:58 pm More Comments Sex sells. Even in governorâ€™s races. That appears to be what the Democratic Party of Virginia was thinking when it distributed racy posters to college campuses, looking to educate students about Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli IIâ€™s (R) support for the commonwealthâ€™s controversial anti-sodomy law. As was first reported by the Hampton Roads TV station WAVY, two posters spotted last weekend at Norfolk State University say â€œKen Cuccinelli wants to make oral sex a felonyâ€� and urge students to vote Nov. 5. One poster Â says, â€œGet your head in the game,â€� while another Â says, â€œDon't let Election Day go down without you.â€� Both posters say at the bottom that they were paid for by â€œEducation Votes, a project of the Democratic Party of Virginia.â€� They were distributed to other campuses around the state, too, but DPV spokesman Brian Coy said the party has had a change of heart. â€œWhile we feel Virginians deserve to know the truth about Ken Cuccinelliâ€™s extreme social agenda, we apologize to those who were offended,â€� Coy said. â€œWe're working to remove these posters from the campuses in question and they will not be used again.â€� Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia, called the posters â€œpar for the courseâ€� for Virginia Democrats. â€œNot only does it repeat this thoroughly-debunked Terry McAuliffe falsehood,â€� Shipley said, â€œbut it manages to do it in an even more crass and tasteless way than before . ... Mailers and posters like this are what you get when your candidates have no record to run on. The Democratic Party of Virginia should be ashamed. But theyâ€™re probably not.â€� The posters are a reference to Virginiaâ€™s â€œcrimes against natureâ€� law, which bans oral and anal sex. The U.S Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that laws which criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults are unconstitutional. Based on that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled this year that Virginiaâ€™s statute was unconstitutional. Cuccinelli has defended the anti-sodomy law as an important tool for prosecuting child predators and appealed that decision. But the U.S. Supreme Court Â  said two weeks ago that it would not hear Cuccinelliâ€™s final appeal. McAuliffe, Cuccinelliâ€™s opponent in the governorâ€™s race, has called for the law to be updated to comport with the 2003 Supreme Court ruling. « Support for marijuana legalization spikes to 58 percent Carney refers questions to HHS â€” 10 times » Also on Post Politics Support for marijuana legalization spikes to 58 percent The Post Most 1 U-Md. student fatally struck by car in College Park identified as N.Y. resident 2 Police investigating deaths of two children in Germantown 3 Hiroo Onoda, Japanese soldier who hid in Philippine jungle for 29 years, dies at 91 4 Fox News host complains no one knows history, then proves it 5 The far right faces the music
