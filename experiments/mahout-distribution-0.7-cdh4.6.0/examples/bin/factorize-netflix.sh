# Instructions:
#
# You can only use this script in conjunction with the Netflix dataset. Unpack the Netflix dataset and provide the
# following:
#
#   1) the path to the folder 'training_set' that contains all the movie rating files
#   2) the path to the file 'qualifying.txt' that contains the user,item pairs to predict
#   3) the path to the file 'judging.txt' that contains the ratings of user,item pairs to predict for
#
# To run:
#  ./factorize-netflix.sh /path/to/training_set/ /path/to/qualifying.txt /path/to/judging.txt
